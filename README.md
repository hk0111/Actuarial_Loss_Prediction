## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run the code here, you will need `Tensorflow` and `nltk` libraries besides those which come pre-installed with the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues on Python 3.x.
## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
We want to predict Workers' Compensation ultimate claim cost using ML algorithms and compare them to actuarial methods. You can find more information about this project at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/actuarial-loss-estimation).
## File Description <a name="description"></a>
There is 1 [notebook file](Actuarial%20Loss%20Prediction.ipynb) to show the processes of analyzing and preparing the data, building the model, evaluating the results, and making prediction on the test data. The [train data](data/train.csv) and [test data](data/test.csv) are also available in the data directory. The predicted results can be found in [`submission.csv`](data/submission.csv) also in the data directory. [Images](images) folder contains images saved from jupyter notebook to show the visualization in the blog post.
## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings can be found at medium post available [here](https://hanskristian0111.medium.com/workers-compensation-claims-prediction-39311e7a90dd).
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/actuarial-loss-estimation) here.
